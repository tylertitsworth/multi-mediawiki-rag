## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report a vulnerability by using [GitHub's Security Reporting Tool](https://github.com/tylertitsworth/multi-mediawiki-rag/security/advisories/new).

## Responding to a Vulnerability Report

Repository administrators will respond to reports rapidly, but at maximum 14 days. After the first response to a report, if the responder cannot reproduce the vulnerability within 48 hours the report will be closed. If the vulernability can be reproduced the report will be classified with a critical priority and triaged as the next contribution to be committed into the repository's default branch.
